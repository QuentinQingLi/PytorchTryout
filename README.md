# PytorchTryout

This repo stores the example projects that I used to learn and try out Pytorch. 

### mnist
This is [the mnist example](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/main/mnist) from [PyTorch Examples](https://pytorch.org/examples/). This example demonstrates how to run image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks ConvNets on the MNIST database. Comments are added to help understand the code flow and pytorch.
